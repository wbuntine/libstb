CONTENTS
========
This directory contains a library "lib/" and some
testing programs "test/".

The library provides alternative ways of computing generalised
second order Stirling numbers used in working with Pitman-Yor
and Dirichlet processes (PYP and DP).  The relevant theory appears in:
     http://arxiv.org/abs/1007.0296v2
and some additional theory is given in "doc/"
(you will have to construct a PDF file from laTeX input).

The library functions are described in the header files:
     stable.h   - tables for log of Stirling numbers
     		  and for ratio of Stirling numbers
     psample.h  - routines for sampling discount (a) and concentration (b)
     sapprox.h  - approximate calcs from difference approximation
     arms.h     - the ARM code from Gilks, used by samplers
     sympoly.h  - evaluation and sampling of elementary symmetric polynomials
		  (useful for some more complex models)

Including is testing programmes, "list.c" and "demo.c", 
an example use as well as a worked
example of posterior sampling on the discount and concentration
parameters of the PYP/DP, in psample.h.  Some core routines in
stable.h are safe to use in a multi-threaded context, and for
this use POSIX thread locking.

While most of the code is under an MPL license, a small set
of library routines are GPL'd.  Thus the library is GPL'd unless
you take the trouble to reconfigure.  

Quick version
=============
If you're happy with the default configuration, and don't want to
use multi-core, and am happy with MPL license (and a few GPL functions),
then here is the short version:

1.  Change to the "lib" directory.
2.  Edit the make file to set CFLAGS options.
3.  Run "make".
4.  Change to the test directory, "test".
5.  Run "make demo".
6.  Run the demo with "./demo" (on Unix box).
    This will finish printing an estimate of T[4].
7.  All going well, change directory back to "lib"
    and copy "libstb.a" to a suitable library directory
    and copy "*.h" to a suitable include directory.


Options
=======
The library functions are self-contained in the default
configuration.  Functions optionally available, sometimes
from external libraries are:
    * digamma functions, necessary, provided by GPL'd code.
    * trigamma and other polygamma functions, used sometimes
      for approximation and for the slice sampler for Newton-Raphson
       of the concentration parameter b, optionally provided by GSL.
    * random number generators, using rand48 (by default)
    * beta, gamma and Gaussian samplers, provided by GPL'd code.
These dependencies are isolated in "lib/digamma.h" and
"lib/rng.h" so redefine these to change these around.

Defines used to configure the system are:
S_USE_THREADS in "stable.h":
                 by default undefined
        Define so that some of the routines are safe to use in
        concurrent threads.  The main issue here is that the library 
        allows the tables to be extended as needed on the fly.
        This needs to be done is such a way that no tables disappear
        temporarily during rebuilding and that two different
        threads don't concurrently try to rebuild the same table.
	Concurrent safe routines are: 
             S_S(), S_U(), S_V(), S_S1(), S_UV(), S_report(),
        and all others should not be used inside multiple threads.
SAMPLEA_M in "psample.h": 
	         by default undefined
	Define this for an experimental way of sampling
        discount.  Often faster.  It goes and regenerates
        all the table occupancies, the full configuration of
        the Chinese restaurant ... possible in linear time
	using the Stirling numbers.  With the configuration
	one can then resample discount without needing
        the Stirling numbers table.
PSAMPLE_ARS in "psample.h": 
	        by default defined
	Use the ARS (adaptive rejection sampling) routine
        to sample hyperparamaters, not slice sampling.
        Slice sampling works well for sampling the discount,
        but when sampling concentration with large data numbers,
        We need to start off with a bit of gradient ascent to
        get us into a better starting place, and this requires
        polygamma functions ... digamma gradient.
LS_NOPOLYGAMMA in "digamma.h": 
	        by default undefined
	Choosing not to use polygamma functions is an option
        if you use the ARS, set by defining PSAMPLE_ARS.
	Some functions may work a little bit slower.
        If using slice sampling, polygamma functions are essential.
GSL_POLYGAMMA in "digamma.h": 
	        by default undefined
	If LS_NOPOLYGAMMA is not defined, then define this
        to use the standard GSL polygamma functions.
	Otherwise, the Mathlib GPL'd versions available
        in the code will be used.
     

Building
=======
Tested (without threads) on a few versions on Ubuntu Linux and MacOSX,
and a Windows XP using gcc.
The S_USE_THREADS option only tested under Linux.
If "lib/digamma.h" and "lib/rng.h" are unchanged you will not need
any prerequisites.
Note to compile faster versions, modify your compile time flags
accordingly,  e.g.,  -O5 -DNDEBUG

   cd lib
   #  make the library
   make
   cd ..
   #  optional, should compile OK if lib did
   cd test
   #  - a simple value lister, lets you see the values
   make list
   #  - see what it does
   ./list
   #  - create the "demo" executable with all sorts of bells and whistles
   #    for evaluating the Stirling numbers
   #  - to see the options, execute:
   #        ./demo -h
   make demo
   #  - check the simple options
   ./demo -h
   #  - run with fitting the concentration
   ./demo -H5 -b 10


Installing
==========
Install the library and the header files if you want other programmes
to make use of the functions in the library.
Copy the library "lib/libstb.a" and the header files 
"stable.h", "sapprox.h", to wherever is useful for you.
If using the parameter samplers, samplea() and sampleb(), then
you also need "psample.h", "arms.h", "rng.h" and "lgamma.h".
    #  PREFIX is the root directory for installation
    cp lib/*.h $PREFIX/include/
    cp lib/libstb.a $PREFIX/lib/


Detail
======
The following files give links to key libraries that you can 
change if you want to alter dependencies
or remove use of the GPL'd code:
	rng.h digamma.h  
Discussion of options for setting this up *without* GPL'd code is
above in "options".

For testing purposes, the following is kept: yaps.h

To see how to use the library in more detail, see the examples
in "test/list.c" and "test/demo.c".  This also shows how to do posterior sampling
on the discount and concentration parameters of the PYP/DP.

In addition, "precision_test.c" is a stand alone program to
compare the two Stirling number recursions when done in
float versus double.  This is intended to evaluate how the
finite precision affects the calculations, and demonstrates
the "ratio of Stirling number" recursion is far more
accurate.

The adaptive rejection sampling code from:
   http://www1.maths.leeds.ac.uk/~wally.gilks/adaptive.rejection/web_page/Welcome.html
is included as "arms.h" and "arms.c".
This is on since the slice sampler is off by default.
Note the slice sampler needs the polygamma function defined
(see "digamma.h" to enable it).
Note naive slice sampling *doesn't* work when sampling the concentration
parameter ... you need to warm up the sampler with a bit of fixed
point optimisation.

See the relevant "#define" in "lib/psample.h".

LICENSES
========

WARNING:   The default configuration uses samplers grabbed
from the GSL and polygamma functions grabbed from MathLib/R.
This is done to keep the library completely self contained.
These other codes are under GPL license.  To avoid the use of the GPLed
code you will need to redefine these.  Note if the slice sampler
is not used, the polygamma functions are not needed, and a
digamma function is available, so all you will need to
provide are the samplers.

The two files "gslrandist.c" and "polygamma.c" are under GPL and 
the license details are given at the top of the files.
The files "arms.[ch]" have no specified license and author is Wally Gilks.

The two header files DEIntegrationConstants.h DEIntegrator.h come
from John D. Cook so should not be further used without reference 
to his original sources:
